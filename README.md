## Hi there! 👋

💬 I'm Vignesh, a high school student interested in pursuing computer science and statistics in college, with the goal of becoming a software engineer or machine learning engineer.

<br>

⚡ I created this GitHub account to improve my  documentation skills and to incorporate open-source projects into my applications.

<br>

💼 Currently I'm a **Software Engineering Intern at Jetson** (VC-backed startup), and a **Data Analyst Intern at STEM•E Youth Career Development Program** (large youth-oriented nonprofit). In the past, I've interned as a **Data Science & ML Intern** at Drippy (local AI/ML startup).

<br>

I've received several recognitions for my technical work, including:
 - 🎯 **National Cyber Scholar** ($3,400 award; <3% selection rate)
 - 👨‍💻 **CyberStart America National Hackathon Finalist** (Top 100/35,000)
 - 💸 **Jetson Entrepreneur-in-Residence Scholarship** ($3,000 VC-backed award)
