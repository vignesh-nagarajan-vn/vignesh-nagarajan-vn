# Hi there! 👋

💬 I'm Vignesh, a high school student interested in pursuing computer science and statistics in college, with the goal of becoming a software engineer or machine learning engineer.

<br>

🎯 Due to my perfect 1520 score on the PSAT Exam and my rigorous academic courseload consisting of 16 APs, 6 Honors at BASIS Phoenix and 8 DEs at Paradise Valley Community College, I aim to finish an accelerated BS (CS & Stats) + MCS program in 4 years through a full-tuition/full-ride scholarship.
